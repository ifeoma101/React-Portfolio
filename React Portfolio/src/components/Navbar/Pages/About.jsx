        I bring a unique blend of healthcare expertise and a keen interest in front-end web development to the table. My journey began in the world of pharmacy, where I honed my skills in understanding and addressing the needs of patients. However, I found myself increasingly drawn to the realm of technology and design, particularly in crafting intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. Eager to expand my horizons, I delved into learning front-end web development, driven by the desire to create impactful digital experiences that resonate with users. With a strong foundation in pharmacy and a burgeoning proficiency in web development, I am excited to leverage my diverse background to create innovative solutions that seamlessly blend healthcare and technology.
